# A File Upload Server

## Why?
cause i can. and cause im tired of my friends complaining about not being able to upload files larger than 8mb on discord. also its fun.

## Should I use it?
idk if you want. it only works half the time, though (as of now, trying to fix that)

## How do I set it up
1. `git clone https://github.com/okawaffles/okayucdnv3.git`
2. edit index.js and stuff to match your domain or something, if you want.
3. `npm ci`
4. `node .`

### To-do
- Clean up index.js (mainly the first part of the file)
- Switch to new config system

### Notes
this repo is very messy and honestly i probably wont clean it up.
this isn't intended to be used as a major server and is mainly a hobby project to me.
